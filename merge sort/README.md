# Merge Sort

**Time Complexity :**

- **In Worst Case :**  O(n*log n)
- **In Best Case :**  O(n*log n)
- **In Average Case :**  O(n*log n)

**Space Complexity :**

Space Complexity is O(n)

**NOTE :**

it follows the divide and conquere method where large array is splitted into multiple arrays untill the size of the array reaches size of 1. Then it will merge all the arrays by comparing elements in it. It uses the recursive function to achieve this
